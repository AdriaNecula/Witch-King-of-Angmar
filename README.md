## Welcome to my First Site!

My name is Adria Julia Necula and this is my first attempt to create a WebSite.
I've never had the occasion to deal with codes, programming or markdowns, therefore this is quite new and difficult for me. I come from a different background, studying Science of Comunication in Siena, and the only knowledge that I have about computers in general comes from my simple experience with Videogames.

I'll try my best to keep up with all the Tutorial and Videos, trying to learn as much as possible and perhaps, one day, starting to customize this page and add even more material to it.
